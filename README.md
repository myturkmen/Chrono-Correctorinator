This code is generated to fix the incorrect timestamps of images and videos due to some reasons such as downloading backup data or moving from one source to another etc.
It only works for WhatsApp and Samsung media (videos and images) (I couldn't see a relation between names and times of media on Apple).
It doesn't work for the files on subfolders. The input folder must include the media directly.
Output folders are going to be archived. If the outputs will be moved, choose the archived ones otherwise the dates are going to be corrupted again.
The ".exe" file was created for the ones who don't have or prefer Python. Both do the same thing.
