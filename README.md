This software is developed to fix incorrect timestamps in images and videos caused by various factors, such as downloading from a backup or moving from one source to another.
It only works for WhatsApp and Samsung media (videos and images) (I couldn't see a relation between names and times of media on Apple).
It doesn't work for the files in subfolders. The input folder must include the media directly.
Output folders will be archived. If the outputs will be moved, choose the archived ones; otherwise, the dates will be corrupted again.
The ".exe" file was created for the ones who don't have or prefer Python. Both do the same thing.
